I'm a cognitive scientist working on categorization and conceptual knowledge. In general, my research has been focused on understanding how humans use concepts to reason, learn, and retrieve contents from semantic memory. To achieve this goal, I employ methods from experimental psychology and computational modeling. 

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez in Chile, funded by the [James S. McDonnell Foundation (JSMF)](https://grants.jsmf.org/2022-3930/){:target="_blank"}. The project is directed by [Sergio Chaigneau](https://psicologia.uai.cl/profesor/sergio-chaigneau/){:target="_blank"} in collaboration with [Enrique Canessa](https://ingenieria.uai.cl/profesor/enrique-canessa/){:target="_blank"} and [Sebastián Moreno](https://ingenieria.uai.cl/profesor/sebastian-moreno/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in Cognitive and Social Neuroscience supervised by Sergio Chaigneau.

I also enjoy collaborating and sharing ideas. My work on causal categorization has received substantial contributions from Sergio Chaigneau, [Guillermo Puebla](https://guillermopuebla.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}, and [Tadeg Quillien](https://sites.google.com/view/tadeg-quillien/home?authuser=0){:target="_blank"}. If you are interested in these ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me.
